We investigated the background concepts needed in reinforcement learning. We learned about environments, policies, and reward functions. WE also learned about the epsilon greedy strategy. We learned about Q-learning, which is an algorithmn that can be used in small-ish state spaces. However, connect 4 is far too large for Q-learning. So, we want to use neural nets to Deep Q-learn.
